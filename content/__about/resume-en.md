# Erick Saavedra

<div align="justify">

Following my passion of being able to combine hardware and software, I participated in a coding bootcamp in Lima, Peru, which focused on front-end and back-end programming; the main goal of participating in that bootcamp was to start a new career as a full-stack developer. Part of my goal is to create fast and scalable solutions that can be maintained over time, focusing on the problem at hand along with the most optimal solution.

Are you passionate about talking about technology? Write me! I'd love to chat with you :)

Some of my skills and interests include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Git.

_Thank you for reading my resume. If you want to contact me, Please send me an email to esvdrah@gmail.com._
